# Our Awesome 30th Anniversary Trip to Japan

In late October of 2019, Sue & I traveled to Japan for our (delayed) 30th
anniversary trip.  We had an amazing time.  This is a blog post about our
adventures.

## First Stop -- Tokyo

We flew on Friday evening, 10/25/2019, to Haneda airport.  The flight
(which was on ANA) took off three hours late for no obvious reason,
and landed two hours late.  Imagine our shock when, after clearing 
customs, ANA employees flagged us down and gave us each 15,000 Yen
(around $150 each) as compensation for a late arrival!

As it was nearly midnight on Saturday night, we just went to our hotel
(the Century Southern Tier, located conveniently at the Shinjuku
train station), and went to sleep.

### Sunday October 27

Our first stop that morning was the Senso-Ji Buddhist temple in the Asakusa
neighborhood.  We will talk about shrines and temples a lot, so here is a helpful
guide.  Japanese people seem to be mostly observing both Buddhist and Shinto
traditions.  There are many Buddhist temples (indicated by -Ji in the name)
and many Shinto shrines (indicated by -Jinju in the name).  Many Japanese go
to both, usually for different types of life events.

Then we headed over to the Akihabara neighborhood (the electronics and Manga capital
of Tokyo) for a free walking tour of the area.  On the way we stopped for "conveyor
belt sushi".  It cost like $20 for the 2 of us and was some of the best sushi I ever
remember having!

Our tour with Hiroshi (the company: Tokyo Localized) was great.  And he was so
entertaining and informative.  We learned about the general background/history
of Japan -- including the Edo period (isolationist Shogunate 1603-1860's) and
the Meiji restoration (1868-).  This put in context the importance of Kyoto
(emperor's capital) and Tokyo (more the Shogunate's capital).  We also learned
about more modern stuff, like the origin of Akihabara's connection to
electronics -- US GI's selling old radio parts post war -- and modern cultural
phenomena like Maid Cafe's (cafes where the waitresses call you "master" --
weird), "Otaku" (manga geek) culture, and AKB48 -- the girl band which is more
like a reality show  Meanwhile we also saw a Shinto shrine (Kanda Myoujin), a
Confucian temple, had some amazing soft serve ice cream, and ended the tour at
the statue of the Last Samaurai, in Ueno park.  I would highly recommend this
tour and the tourguide, too!

### Monday October 28

We started our day with a walking tour of Meiji-Jinju and Harajuku, led by Emi
of Tokyo Localized (again).  Started with Meiji shrine — in a beautiful tree
lined setting.  Then Takeshita Street — crazy street lined with sweet food and
cute stuff and some goth all seemingly targeted towards Japanese teen girls —
kind of crazy. Then Yoyogi Park for just a few minutes. 

After the tour, we headed over to the traditional coffee house Chatei Haitou.
Absolutely amazing coffee!! He used a Kalita Wave, by the way.  Probably the
best pourover I've ever had.

From there we waked around the Shibuya area -- saw Shibuya Crossing, an amazing
5-way intersection with waves of people crossing each light.  Next to Shibuya
Hikarie department store.  Then walked back to our hotel via Yoyogi Park /
Meiji Jinju.

Dinner at "Udon Shin", a tiny udon place in the back streets of Shibuya.  You
order before you even get seated.  A great cheap dinner!

That evening we walked over to Tokyu Hands, a multi floor department store with
one floor dedicated just to crafts and home projects!

### Tuesday October 29

First thing, we went to meet with artist Kazuko Shihashi.  We had been
introduced to her work by Ali Hacket's friend Kamala in London.  We met her,
her daughter, and a man who was teaching her to perform tea ceremonies.  After
viewing her work she actually performed a ceremony for us.  It was very
beautiful!!

Next stop was the "Borderless Labs" interactive art exhibit.  Very cool
walk-through-it art.  Back home to the hotel and had sushi on the restaurant
floor of "Shinjuku Times Square".

###  Wednesday October 30

In the morning we visited the East Gardens of the Imperial Palace grounds.
Afterwards we went up to the Lawn.  They were literally building a small
village, specifically for a ceremony which takes place on the change of
emperor!  I mean a whole village for one ceremony.

Afterwards we walked to Ginza and saw Sony Square and Ginza crossing. We
visited Itōya — a 12 floor stationery store!  Bought some cards and had lunch
at the cafe on top floor. 

Then on to Cafe de l’ambre — another "OG" coffee shop of Tokyo. Aged beans
(!?). The coffee servings were much smaller than Chatei Hatou and the place was
much more cramped and rushed.  I also think the coffee was just objectively
better at Chatei Hatou. 

We then visited Hama-rikyu gardens. Previously these were shore recreational
lands of the Shoguns, and then reverted to the Emperor after the restoration.
Now it's a public park. In the park there are carefully researched and
reconstructed tea houses and other buildings. 

But the highlight of the day was definitely the Night tour of Shinjuku.  First
Memory Lane AKA "Piss Alley" — yakitori and beer in dozens of tiny places in a
smoky alley.  Then Kibuki Town  — restaurants mainly with also people outside
recruiting customers for some other Yakuza-owned places.  Stay away from them! 

Then Red Light District -- we learned about the 5 different kind of sexual
services mostly legally available: massage, escort, (two others I forget), and
Soap Houses.  Prostitution is illegal but weirdly this just means money for
intercourse. Other sex stuff is legal.  

Then there are host (or hostess) clubs. No sex. Just "girlfriend experience"
(or boyfriend). Hugely expensive and most famous boy made 2.2M$ in a year. Then
Love hotels: 2 hours, 6 hours, overnight. Very commonly used by Japanese. Most
have been for various reasons. Finally Golden Gai — 100 small (ten person)
themed bars which are pretty much the only place Japanese who are not in the
same group will speak to each other.  (Otherwise it's considered rude to 
"abandon" your friends or co-workers.)

This wrapped up Tokyo for us.  A great ending to an amazing 5 days.

## Next Stop, Hakone and the Foot Hills of Mt Fuji

The next phase of our trip was much more rural!

### Thursday October 31

On Thursday morning we got on a JR "Shinkansen" (bullet train) and headed to
Odawara station.  Almost didn't get off in time!  Thence to a local train to
Hakone, and then a taxi to our "semi-traditional" hotel -- the Manatei spa.
Like a Ryokan (traditional hotel) -- but with beds!

The first thing we did after checking in, was to check out the Hakone Open Air
Museum.  Many really great sculptures including a whole Picasso section.  All
in a beautiful setting in the mountains.  We used buses to get around -- and
they were amazingly easy to use, with a "SUICA" (IC) card, english
announcements, and great coverage in google maps.

That evening we went back to our hotel, where we were given traditional garb.
We "dressed for dinner".  We had a private room in the restaurant, and had a
multi-course (12 courses?) traditional "Kaiseki" meal.  They were very careful
about our dietary restrictions -- and we could eat absolutely everything!

### Friday November 1

On Friday morning we headed out to catch a bus, to a cable car (which we would
call a funicular, to a "rope way" (which we would probably call a cable car or
gondola, and got amazing views of Mt Fuji as we traveled.  The vehicles made
multiple stops and one could get off and walk around.

We passed over a smoking volcanic field -- kind of looks hellish!  It was not
possible to get off there due to excess volcanic activity.

Ultimately we landed on the shore of Lake Ashi.  We took a boat across the lake
to Hakonemachi.  There we took a quick look at the "Shogun Checkpoint museum".
During the Edo period the Shoguns kept a checkpoint at this mountain pass.
Oddly one of the key reasons for the checkpoint was to ensure that the wives of
the Daimyo (vassal shoguns of outlying regions) did not escape from Edo (Tokyo)
where they were being held as hostage to guarantee the fealty of the Daimyo.

We walked along the shore of Lake Ashi to MotoHakone and then continued on.  We
visited the Hakone shrine there.

Ultimately we grabbed a bus and returned to our hotel.  We visited the Onsen
(hot bath).  We chose the "private family baths", since we are not too
interested in public bathing.  Afterwards we we had another amazing Kaiseki
meal.

## Hiroshima and Miyajima Island

Phase II of our trip -- Hiroshima Area.  The goal is just to see the museum and
the sights related to the bombing while in Hiroshima, and then visit the lovely
Miyajima Island nearby.


### Saturday November 2

Saturday morning we took a taxi to Odawara station and caught the Shinkansen to
Hiroshima via Shin-Osaka.  Because we did not have a reservation, and it was a
very busy weekend (due to Culture Day in Japan), we had to stand almost all the
way to Shin Osaka!  (90 minutes or so).  

When we arrived in Hiroshima we checked into our hotel -- the Granvia at
Hirohshima station.  We tried to visit the Manga Reading Room but due to a
miscommunication, ended up in the Manga section of a small public library in
the suburbs of Hiroshima.  It was interesting to see what those suburbs looked
like.  We also learned a bit about how popular the Manga form is for reading
material in Japan.  It can even be used to teach educational topics some times.

That evening we walked in "Peace Memorial Park" and saw the Bomb Dome memorial.
This is a building right under the epicenter of the blast, which survived and
is now left in place as a memorial.  Very spooky.

We walked around the area and ended up having dinner at a Mazeman Raman (dry
raman) place called Okkundo Otemachi.  Was a tiny place but really good and
cheap and the staff was super nice!  (It's well rated on Trip Advisor BTW.)

### Sunday November 3

We started the day with the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum.  Reall, how to
describe this.  The most similar feeling I can remember is when I've visited
graphic Holocaust memorials.  The human suffering involved is unimaginable but
the museum does a good job of causing you to confront this.  Really they manage
to focus on the importance of peace and show surprisingly little bitterness
in their exhibits, both human and historical.

Afterwards we ate "Okonomiyaki" pancakes in Hiroshima Station for lunch.  Oko
is really almost any combination of (normally savory) ingredients, often
involving noodles and cabbage, often pork (not for us), and egg.  They are
pervasive and made different ways in different cities.  (We ended up having
very different Oko in Kyoto with Howard and Hitomi later in the trip.

Next we took the train and then a ferry to Miyajima.  We saw the Itsukuru
"floating" shrine.  Unbelieveably packed!  Fortunately we were staying on the
island so we didn't have to leave that night.  We were able to walk around in
the evening and see the shoreline, and the really amazing Daisho-In temple up
the hill.  (Probably my favorite Buddhist Temple of the trip.)  Sue loved the
little Buddha's wearing knitted caps -- which we ended up calling Jewdas
because their little caps looked like kippot!

Interesting observation:  a guy cleaning his dog's butt.  I mean they are just
so clean here.

We then had a course traditional dinner at hotel.  Though I'd have to say the
one at Manatei in Hakone was better.

We had a boat ride at night. All in Japanese but nice to be on the water in the
brisk night.  Finally back to the hotel for a quick onsen foot bath wearing our
hotel-provided kimonos. 

### Monday November 4

The next morning we woke up early to get a start before the morning rush of
tourists arrived.  We took the ropeway to Mt Misen. Really beautiful 360 views.
We hiked down by way of the Daisho In temple.  Sue got a chance to take like
100 more shots of the Jewdas...

We then headed back by ferry and train to Hiroshima, and caught the Shinkansen
to Kyoto.  We arrived at Kyoto Station in the late afternoon and checked in to
the Granvia hotel at the station.  Very reasonable cost and really probably the
best "standard" hotel we stayed at on the trip.  We took a trip along the
11-floor outdoor escalator to see the majestic station and the Isetan
department store, a quick dinner at the hotel restaurant and then to bed.
